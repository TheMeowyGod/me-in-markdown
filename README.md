# Introduction:
My name is Victor Rush. I'm in 10th grade. My favorite movie is One Piece film Red because every song in the movie was sung by my favorite artist and each song perfectly fit the themes of the scenes shown. The movie had great animation and fit the story of the series. I recently learned how to play pedal tones on the trumpet, which has increased my range and helps make playing other notes easier. This year I'll be doing AP Calculus, which is a level of math I didn't think I'd be doing in 10th grade. A fun fact about myself is that I have 3 cats. My goals for this school year are to get good grades (preferably A's and B's if an A isn't possible at the time) and to score high on the AP exams in May. During the summer I went to St. George, Utah where I visited a family member and watched the fireworks on the fourth of july. A special food this summer was sand bass tacos that we caught in the sea, mostly because I accidently got a bone in one of my bites.

 I hope to further enhance my knowledge in computer science and learn more about jobs in technology.My most memorable experience in summer was the first day I used the boxing equipment at the small gym I went to. I learned some boxing basics and was able to train once a week for around 3 weeks. Last school year I was a part of a group that made a roblox game for a PBL, where we made an fast fashion obby. I'm currently in the CCHS marching band where we are current LAUSD champions. Our field show this year is Cirque du Soleil: Ka and I'm the lead trumpet of the band.

 A creative endeavor I participated in is marching band. Last year we did the field show Summer of Love, with the video being on youtube. [Click me for show!] My favorite summer memory with my friends was when I had my late brithday party and we were all "singing" in by backyard while eating burgers. We had a lot of fun bowling that day and hung out in my living room playing my ps4 until they all left.
